# Convolutional Neural Network Autoencoders for Jets
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) autoencoder on jet images in particle physics, used as a baseline for the [LGAE](https://github.com/zichunhao/lgn-autoencoder).

## Prepare Data
To prepare the data for training and testing, run the following script.
```bash
python3 data/preprocess.py --save-dir "data"
```
